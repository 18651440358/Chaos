Everything starts with chaos...

This is an interface application that can quickly initialize various development environments for learning or development. This is my undergraduate graduation project. The design ideas for this project came from me and my mentor [<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Niit-%20Xu%20Yiqing-brightgreen" />](https://github.com/yiqingxu). 

## Design ideas
We found that there are many situations in daily class that need to configure the development environment. For example, for a Java Web project, we need to install JDK, Mysql, Tomcat, etc. in a Linux-based server instance. Most of the students will have problems during the installation, which will make it impossible to proceed.

## Innovative design
Our software will solve the cumbersome environment configuration and installation problems on the eve of development, so that developers only need to focus on the development process, without considering possible configuration problems or version conflicts.

No need to install additional VM virtualization, create and manage virtual images through interface. Has less memory and computing power requirements than VM virtual machines, lowering the threshold for using virtual machines.

## Version & compatibility
Version 1.0 Alpha Support operating system
- Windows
- macOS
